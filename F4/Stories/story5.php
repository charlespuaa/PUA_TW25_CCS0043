        <h2>CJ's Wedding</h2>
        <p>
            CJ, the only brother, is getting married to Princess. But what should be a joyful event is interrupted by
            the chaos his sisters bring. As secrets unfold and old wounds open, CJ finds himself torn between family
            loyalty and love. In the end, the wedding becomes more than a ceremony—it’s a catalyst for healing.
