        <h2>Teddy's Story</h2>
        <p>
            Teddy, the eldest, once carried the weight of the family on her shoulders. She left to work abroad, thinking
            it would make everything better. But distance made things more complicated—especially with her relationship
            with her siblings. She returned home not only to attend CJ’s wedding but also to face unresolved tensions
            and rediscover her role as a sister.
