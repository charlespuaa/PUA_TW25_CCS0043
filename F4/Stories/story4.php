        <h2>Gabbie's Story</h2>
        <p>
            Gabbie stayed behind and took care of their mother and CJ. She’s the quiet glue of the family. Often
            overlooked, she silently carried the burden of keeping peace. CJ’s wedding brought everything to the
            surface—and gave Gabbie the moment to speak up and remind everyone of what truly matters.
