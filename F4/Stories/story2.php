        <h2>Bobbie's Story</h2>
        <p>
            Bobbie, the most career-driven among the sisters, built a life in New York. But success came with a
            priceâ€”feeling distant and misunderstood. Coming home for CJ's wedding brought back feelings of being judged
            and unappreciated. Through conflicts and conversations, Bobbie starts to realize the power of being
            emotionally present for family.
